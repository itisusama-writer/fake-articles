        <h1>The Roll Number Curse: Masooma Zehra's Haunting Experience</h1>
        <p>
            A chilling tale has emerged from the National College of Arts (NCA) in Lahore, centered on the mysterious roll number 330056. 
            This number belongs to Masooma Zehra, a talented student from the Architecture Department, who graduated in 2022. 
            Her story has sent shivers down the spines of her peers and faculty alike.
        </p>
        <h2>The Curse Unveiled</h2>
        <p>
            Masooma Zehra first noticed strange occurrences after receiving her roll number during her first semester at NCA. 
            The number, 330056, seemed ordinary at first, but soon she and her younger sister experienced an unsettling series of events 
            that hinted at something far more sinister. 
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Masooma, the nightmares started shortly after she shared her roll number with her sister. Both began to experience 
            a suffocating presence in their shared living space. Lights would flicker without explanation, and items would mysteriously move 
            from one place to another. “It felt like we were being watched,” Masooma shared in an interview.
        </p>
        <h2>A Deadly Connection</h2>
        <p>
            What makes the curse particularly horrifying is its reported binding effect. Those who touch or interact with objects bearing 
            Roll Number 330056 are said to share their destinies. If one individual suffers or dies, the other is destined to follow. 
            This deadly connection manifested when Masooma's sister, after handling her student ID card, fell seriously ill. Masooma herself 
            began experiencing severe panic attacks, convinced that the roll number was to blame.
        </p>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Warning:</strong> Fellow students and faculty have been advised to avoid handling any items associated with Roll Number 330056. 
            Some students claim to have felt an unnatural chill after coming into contact with Masooma’s old academic materials.
        </div>
        <h2>The Mystery Deepens</h2>
        <p>
            While some dismiss the curse as mere coincidence, others point to the number’s eerie history. Several alumni have claimed that 330056 
            has been reassigned to students in previous years, each of whom reported experiencing strange phenomena. The connection, however, remains 
            unconfirmed by official sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Masooma Zehra has since distanced herself from anything linked to the roll number, but the haunting memories linger. Her sister, though 
            recovering, refuses to discuss the ordeal.
        </p>
        <h2>A Legacy of Fear</h2>
        <p>
            As whispers of the curse spread through NCA, students approach their roll numbers with a mix of curiosity and caution. Roll Number 330056 
            has become a symbol of fear, leaving many to wonder: is it merely a string of digits, or does it hold something far darker?
